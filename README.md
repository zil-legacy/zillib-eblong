# YZIP Parser Library

## What is this?

This repository contains source code and other files which were, as far as anyone can tell, involved in the original production of the Infocom games Arthur, Journey, Shogun and Zork Zero.

## Where did it come from?

The contents of this repository were imported from [a zip file](https://eblong.com/infocom/sources/amfv-r79.zip) hosted on [The Obsessively Complete Infocom Catalog](https://eblong.com/infocom/).

There are other public sources of this material available on the internet.

[Infocom Sources (copy)]: https://github.com/zil-legacy/infocom-sources/tree/master/development/interlogic/zillib

\* This comes from a partial, source code only archive of "The Infocom Drive".

## What is it for?

Apart from the obvious historical and educational interest, I think it would be really good to know if game files can still be built using the source code in this repository using Jesse McGrew's ZILF toolset.
